# Upload-data-to-Thingspeak-using-Arduino-Uno-Ethernet-Interfacing-
Arduino Uno is connected to the network using the Ethernet Shield. The sensor readings are then uploaded onto the Thingspeak account for further analysis using HTTP communication.

In this tutorial, we will need Ethernet Shield, Arduino Uno, RJ45 cable, LED and a Thingspeak account. We monitor the status of the LED and load the data into the Thingspeak account. On Thingspeak, we can use the data to create visualizations to analyze or monitor the data real-time. It is a open IoT platform which can be used to collect, analyze data and perform some action.
